# Error codes

Smart Router classifies every upstream failure into an internal **error code** used
for logging, metrics, and retry decisions. Each code has a name, a layer, and a
**retryable** flag that the failover state machine reads when deciding whether to
rotate to another node.

!!! info "These codes are internal — clients never see them"
    Smart Router is a transparent hop: your client always receives the **original**
    error from the upstream node, unmodified (the same JSON-RPC / HTTP / gRPC error
    you'd get talking to the node directly). Lava error codes appear only in the
    router's **logs** and in the [`smartrouter_errors_total`](metrics.md#classified-errors-smartrouter_errors_)
    metric. Use this
    page to interpret those logs and metrics — not to handle codes on the wire.

The registry lives in
[`protocol/common/error_registry.go`](https://github.com/Magma-Devs/smart-router/blob/main/protocol/common/error_registry.go).

## The four layers at a glance

| Layer | Range | Category | Means | Typical retryable? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`PROTOCOL_*`](#layer-a-protocol-errors-protocol_-10001999) | 1000s | Internal | The router's own plumbing — connection, session, consistency. | Mostly **yes** |
| [`NODE_*`](#layer-b-node-errors-node_-20002999) | 2000s | External | The node responded with an error (5xx, rate-limit, syncing, method-not-found). | Mixed |
| [`CHAIN_*`](#layer-c-blockchain-errors-chain_-30003999) | 3000s | External | The chain's execution/state layer (revert, nonce, block-not-found). | Mixed |
| [`USER_*`](#layer-d-user-errors-user_-40004999) | 4000s | External | The client sent a bad request (malformed JSON, invalid params). | **No** |

**Rule of thumb:** `PROTOCOL_*` / `NODE_*` 5xx are infra noise that failover absorbs;
a spike in `CHAIN_*` or `USER_*` usually means a client or contract problem, not your
deployment.

## Where you'll see these

In **logs** (structured fields on every classified failure):

```json
{"level":"warn","error_name":"NODE_RATE_LIMITED","error_category":"External",
 "retryable":true,"chain_id":"ETH1","chain_error_code":429,
 "chain_error_message":"429 Too Many Requests","provider":"eth-publicnode"}
```

In **metrics** (`smartrouter_errors_total`, labelled by name/category/retryability/chain):

```promql
# Which errors are firing, by name?
sum by (error_name) (rate(smartrouter_errors_total[5m]))

# Terminal (non-retryable) errors only — these reach the client
sum by (error_name) (rate(smartrouter_errors_total{retryable="false"}[5m]))
```

## Debugging with error codes

| You see… | Likely cause | Next step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NODE_RATE_LIMITED` climbing | A node is throttling you | Add upstreams, or check your node plan; failover already spreads load. |
| `PROTOCOL_NO_PROVIDERS` | The pool emptied for a relay | Every node was excluded — check health and the [circuit breaker](../configuration/failover/circuit-breaker.md). |
| `CHAIN_STATE_PRUNED` on historical queries | Hitting a non-archive node | Mark archive upstreams with the `archive` addon; see [config](../configuration/config-file.md). |
| `NODE_METHOD_NOT_FOUND` | Method isn't on that node's surface | Terminal + cached; confirm the chain spec actually exposes it. |
| `USER_*` spike | Clients sending bad requests | Not an infra issue — inspect the offending client. |
| `CHAIN_EXECUTION_REVERTED` | Contract reverted | Expected for failing `eth_call` / sims — terminal, not retried. |

## How classification works

Errors are classified with a two-level, chain-family-aware lookup:

1. **Tier 2 — chain-specific** matchers run first. They exist only where a chain's
   error means something with *different* retryability than the generic pattern
   (e.g. Solana `-32009` vs `-32007`, Bitcoin warmup, Starknet class errors).
2. **Tier 1 — generic semantic** matchers are the fallback, partitioned by transport
   (`jsonrpc` / `rest` / `grpc`) so an EVM chain never evaluates gRPC matchers and
   vice-versa.

Connection-level failures (timeouts, refused, reset, context cancellation) are
detected before either tier and always take precedence. Anything unmatched becomes
`UNKNOWN_ERROR` (code `0`, retryable).

### Retry, CU, and caching

`retryable` is the primary signal: a `retryable: No` classification short-circuits
retries on **every** terminal error, not just unsupported methods. Two sub-categories
carry extra behaviour:

- **Unsupported method** (`NODE_METHOD_NOT_FOUND`, `NODE_UNIMPLEMENTED`,
  `NODE_ENDPOINT_NOT_FOUND`, `NODE_METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED`) → zero retries, **zero CU**,
  response is cached, no node scoring. The node won't be hit again for it.
- **Rate limit** (`NODE_RATE_LIMITED`) → back off without marking the endpoint
  unhealthy (it's busy, not broken).
- **User-input errors** (`USER_*`) are non-retryable but charge **normal CU** — the
  response isn't cached because the next request from the same client may be valid, so
  the node still does real work.

## Chain families

Tier-2 classification keys off a chain's **family**. An unregistered chain id resolves
to the `Unknown` sentinel — Tier-2 lookups intentionally miss and classification falls
through to the transport-scoped Tier-1 matchers.

| Family | Example chain ids |
| --- | --- |
| `EVM` | ETH1, SEP1, HOL1, ARBITRUM, POLYGON, BASE, OPTM, AVAX, BSC, BLAST, FTM250, SONIC, … |
| `Solana` | SOLANA, SOLANAT, KOII, KOIIT |
| `Bitcoin` | BTC, BTCT, LTC, LTCT, DOGE, DOGET, BCH, BCHT |
| `CosmosSDK` | COSMOSHUB, LAVA, LAV1, AXELAR, EVMOS, OSMOSIS, JUN1, CELESTIA, … |
| `Starknet` | STRK, STRKS |
| `Aptos` | APT1 |
| `Sui` | SUIT |
| `NEAR` | NEAR, NEART |
| `XRP` | XRP, XRPT |
| `Stellar` | XLM, XLMT |
| `TON` | TON, TONT |
| `Tron` | TRX, TRXT |
| `Cardano` | CARDANO, CARDANOT |
| `Unknown` | sentinel — Tier-2 misses, falls through to Tier-1 |
